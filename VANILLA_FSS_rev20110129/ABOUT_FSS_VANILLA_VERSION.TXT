Version 1.0 - FSS (Vanilla Version - Revision 20110128)   

*** Brief notes:
FSS is a family of algorithms suited for optimization in high-dimensional search spaces. 
All fish perform local search and the school aggregates social information. FSS is the 
result of a laborious-collective team work of a long on-going scientific research.

This new approach in Swarm Intelligence was invented by C. Bastos Filho and F. Lima Neto 
in 2007 and extended ever since. The two abovementioned researchers are Head of CIRG 
(Computational Intelligent Research Group) and are based at Polytechnic School (POLI) 
of University of Pernambuco (UPE) in Recife-PE, Brazil 

This package is the first approach of FSS and excels for unimodal hyper-dimensional 
functions. It includes two operators: Feeding and Swimming (considering individual, 
collective-instinctive and collective-volitive movements). Stop conditions conceived 
for FSS are as follows: limit of cycles (the stopping condition of all experiment of 
this paper), time limit, maximum school radius, minimum school weight and maximum fish 
number).

Acknowledgments for the current implementation are credited to Murilo Rebelo Pontes  
who is a former Postgraduate student of CIRG - POLI/UPE and has contributed quite a 
lot with new some developments for the FSS family of algorithms. Murilo can be reached 
via his email at murilo.pontes AT gmail.com
